This file contains my requirements for AI copilot, please never update this file.

General overview:
    - you should create web site for flask/python that will be hosted in Google "Cloud Run" using /dockerfile
    - Add files for SEO, metadata, and keys for best search appearence
    - We are creating a web site about Gems, a hub with all related information
    - See my other web sites in https://github.com/BusyStas/stasclub and https://github.com/BusyStas/stasboston
    - I promote "Defensive Coding" style

Style and design:
    - Avoid too many colors on a screen, I prefer different shades of a color (blue or green, sometimes orange)
    - Consider shades of BLUE to be the main color scheme here
    - I like smaller fonts and condenced space between lines
    
Web Site Navigation:
    - Collapsible left column menu for navigation between pages
    - There should be "a sandwich-bar" to collapse the menu on the left, so only icons are shown
    - Some menu items will be nested
    - Inner menu items should be displayed on the right side of the main menu item when click on the parent menu
        - Inner menus should be of the same style as the main menu items
    - The menu should be consistent across all pages (use INCLUDE and keep the menu in one file)
    - Here are the sections on the menu:
        - Home
        - Type of Gems
            - By hardness
            - By rarity
            - By aviailability

            - Gem Rock Auctions
