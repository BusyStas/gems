This file contains my requirements for AI copilot, please never update this file.

General overview:
    - you should create web site for flask/python that will be hosted in Google "Cloud Run" using /dockerfile
    - Add files for SEO, metadata, and keys for best search appearence
    - We are creating a web site about Gems, a hub with all related information
    - See my other web sites in https://github.com/BusyStas/stasclub and https://github.com/BusyStas/stasboston
    - I promote "Defensive Coding" style
    - Every page should have Google Analytics code installed from /templates/includes/google_tag.html
    - Every time you have an error or exception when you call a database, save it into logs/db_errors.log with timestamp and error description

Style and design:
    - Avoid too many colors on a screen, I prefer different shades of a color (blue or green, sometimes orange)
    - Consider shades of BLUE to be the main color scheme here
    - I like smaller fonts and condenced space between lines
    - Menu should not have borders, and no gaps between submenu pan and the main menu panel
    - Icons that you use for menu items should be one color (no multiple colors), and in the same style
    
Web Site Navigation:
    - Collapsible left column menu for navigation between pages
    - There should be "a sandwich-bar" to collapse the menu on the left, so only icons are shown
    - Some menu items will be nested
    - Inner menu items should be displayed on the right side of the main menu item when click on the parent menu
        - Inner menus should be of the same style as the main menu items
    - The menu should be consistent across all pages (use INCLUDE and keep the menu in one file)
    - Here are the sections on the menu:
        - Home
        - My Profile
        - My Portfolio
        - Type of Gems
            - By hardness

        - Certification Labs

        - Jewelry
            - Customized Jewelry
            - Shopes
    - Every page should have 1 line navigation at the top (separated by a pipe "|"), containing top level navigation
        - the top navigation should not have "Home"
        - the top navigation should not have nested items, only top level items
        - the top navigation should have icon for "My Profile" in the right corner, to the left from "Sign In" (or Logout)
        - the top navigation should have icon for "My Portfolio" to the left from "My Profile"
        - Some menu items should be called with a short name:
            - "Type of Gems" should be called "Gems"
            - "Stores and Auctions" should be called "Auctions"
            - "Certification Labs" should be called "Labs"

    - Formula of "Composite Score" = (Geological_Rarity * 0.25) + (Market_Availability * 0.25) + (Investment_Appropriateness * 0.25) + (Hardness * 0.125) + (Price_Accessibility * 0.125)
    - Having calculated the composite score, assign investment ranking tiers:
        - 80-100: VERY BULLISH ⬆⬆⬆
        - 70-79.99: BULLISH ⬆⬆
        - 50-69.99: MODERATELY BULLISH ⬆
        - 45-49.99: NEUTRAL
        - 30-44.99: BEARISH ⬇

        - Investment Appropriateness
        - Hardness 
    - The investment ranking should be clickable and navigate to "Gem Type Profile" page for that gem type

Page(s) "Gem Type Profile":
    - There should be one such page per each gem type
    - The page URL should be like /gem/GEMTYPE_HERE (all lowercase, spaces replaced with underscores)
    - The page should have the following information:
        - Gem Type Name as the page title
        - Mineral Group
        - Mohs Hardness
        - Typical Size
        - Typical Price Range

    - Investment ranking should be illustrated as a gauge chart showing the composite score on a scale from 0 to 100
        - display it in a box in the top right corner of the page (beginning from the same level as the gem type title)
        - it should be a box similar to what Chaikinanalytics.com uses for its stock ratings
        - first of all display the ranking tier - font size should be big and prominent:
            - bullish and very bullish are green
            - around neutral is orange
            - bearish and very bearish are red
        - show gauge for the overall composite score from red area to green area
            - the main gauge should have a light barely visible border, becuase of the background gradient
            - the gauge needle should point to the composite score on the gauge
        - do not show the label "Composite Score" on the overall gauge, just show the score number (bigger and bold font)
        - show similar progress bar looking gauges for each of the 5 factors that make up the composite score
        - factors gauges should be similar looking but smaller and horizontal
