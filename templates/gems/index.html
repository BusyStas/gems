    <h2>Understanding Gemstones</h2>
    <p>
        Gemstones are naturally occurring minerals, rocks, or organic materials that have been cut, polished, 
        and used in jewelry or for decorative purposes. They are classified into different categories based on 
        their rarity, hardness, and desirability.

    <h3 class="mt-2">Classification of Gems</h3>
    <ul class="info-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Precious Gems:</strong> Historically, only four gemstones were considered "precious": 
            diamond, ruby, sapphire, and emerald. These are the most valuable and sought-after.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Semi-Precious Gems:</strong> All other gemstones are classified as semi-precious, 
            including amethyst, topaz, garnet, aquamarine, and many others.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Organic Gems:</strong> These are materials produced by living organisms, such as 
            pearls (from mollusks), amber (fossilized resin), and coral.
