ranking_factors:
  refractive_index:
    description: "Measure of how much light bends entering the stone"
    impact: "Higher RI = more brilliance and light return"
    
  dispersion:
    description: "Separation of white light into spectral colors"
    impact: "Higher dispersion = more fire and rainbow flashes"
    measurement: "Difference between red and violet refractive indices"
    
  optical_character:
    types:
      - "Singly refractive (SR): Light travels at one speed through crystal"
      - "Doubly refractive (DR): Light splits into two rays, can show doubling"
      - "Amorphous: No crystalline structure, unique optical properties"
    
  birefringence:
    description: "Amount of double refraction (only in DR stones)"
    impact: "High birefringence can cause visible doubling of facets"
    examples:
      high: "Zircon (0.059), Sphene (0.100-0.192)"
      low: "Sapphire (0.008-0.009)"

notes:
  - "Cut quality dramatically affects how well a gem displays its refractive properties"
  - "Some gems with moderate RI can appear brilliant due to excellent cutting"
  - "Dispersion only visible in colorless or lightly colored stones"
  - "Phenomena like asterism, chatoyancy override simple refraction rankings"
